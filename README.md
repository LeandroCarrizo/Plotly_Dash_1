The goal of this dashboard is to make the details of each order visible to the customer attention team. It is built using Plotly Dash and queries a non-relational database with Pymongo. The data is processed using Pandas and Numpy, and the app has been deployed to Heroku. Sensitive information has been removed from the code to maintain data privacy.
